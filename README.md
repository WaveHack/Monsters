# Monsters

My C# playground/test project while learning C# and .NET Core.

Monsters is (to be) a creature collection and battle simulator, inspired by games such as Pokémon, Summoners War, and Monster Sanctuary.

This project is WIP and there's no working user interface yet, other than a rudimentary console application used for testing during development.
